# Submission Notes

I worked on this project using mainly the React JS framework.

## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

If I had more time, I would've added a loading effect.

## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

I have used an open source plugin called react-select to implement the select dropdowns. This plugin allows for a better user experience because it provides the capability to search as well as remove selected items on the fly.

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?

It was a fun project to work on and I learned a lot from it.
